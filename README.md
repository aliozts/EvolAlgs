# EvolAlgs
This repository includes two programs "mainAlg.py" and "experiments.py" 

In "mainAlg.py" there are implementations of several Evolutionary Algorithms(EAs) with and without noise:

-Simple Evolutionary Algorithm with only mutation using Tournament Selection with One-Bit noise/Asymmetric One-Bit Noise and without noise

In "experiments.py" there is te code to create the boxplots for experimentation:
--experimentation is done by running an algorithm 100 times and taking the mean, this process is done 10 times and boxplots are created.

DOCUMENTATION WILL BE UPDATED!
