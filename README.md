# EvolAlgs
This repository includes two programs "mainAlg.py" and "experiments.py" 

In "mainAlg.py" there are implementations of several Evolutionary Algorithms(EAs):

(1 + Lambda)-EA

(Mu + Lambda)-EA

EA with Tournament Selection

EA with (Mu, Lambda) Selection

All the algorithms are implemented with one-bit and asymmetric one-bit noise model. Implementation of the general bit-wise noise model can be found in the code.


In "experiments.py" there is te code to create the boxplots for experimentation:
--experimentation is done by running an algorithm 100 times and taking the mean, this process is done 10 times and boxplots are created.

Documentation will be revised
